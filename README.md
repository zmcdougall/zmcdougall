About
---------
*I am passionate about data and have a proven track record of process improvement within demanding operations environments. Outside of my work hours I am pursuing an MSBA and learning important technologies such as R, Python, and SQL. My favorite class so far has been Statistics and Predictive Analytics. I found modeling to be a fascinating and powerful tool. I believe data driven decisions are almost always superior to decisions based on gut feel alone. I love turning complex datasets into actionable insights.*
